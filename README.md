# kryptopals

The Matasano [cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/) challenges are a series of 66 programming exercises that
demonstrate attacks on real-world crypto. This is my attempt at working through the exercises using the Kotlin
programming language.

All solutions have tests associated with them. To run them simply use:

    ./gradlew clean build test
